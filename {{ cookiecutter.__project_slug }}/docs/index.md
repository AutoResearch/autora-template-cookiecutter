Explain what your contribution is doing here

You can include inline mathematics by wrapping LaTeX formatted math in `$` symbols: `$(3 < 4)$` will render as:  $(3 < 4)$

To include block mathematics wrap the expression with double `$$`:

```
$$
E(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{h}) = -\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \sum_i b_i v_i - \sum_j c_j h_j
$$
```
Will render as:
$$
E(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{h}) = -\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}v_i h_j - \sum_i b_i v_i - \sum_j c_j h_j
$$
