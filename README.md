# Cookiecutter Contribution Template

This is a command line tool for creating the structure of a new AutoRA subpackage. 
[Here](https://autoresearch.github.io/autora/) you can find the documentation for AutoRA.

## Usage

First, install the cookiecutter package. There are a number of [ways](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#) to do so, but we recommend using pip via
```shell
pip install cookiecutter
```

However you choose to install, you'll need version 2.1.1 or greater. To check your version, run
```shell
cookiecutter --version
```

Once you've confirmed your installation, you can create the project by running 
```shell
cookiecutter https://github.com/AutoResearch/autora-template-cookiecutter
```

You will be prompted with a series of questions to customize your project. If a prompt displays, `N/A - Press Enter to Skip`, you can skip the question.

In the created folder you can find a README.md file that gives further instructions.
